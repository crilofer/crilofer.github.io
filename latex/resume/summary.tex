I’ve continuously worked in software engineering for my whole 7+ year career.\newline\newline
Over my career I’ve had the chance to participate in several projects and contributed to different types of system architectures, teams, products and overall tech ecosystems.\newline\newline
At my current professional position, I am responsible for multiple distributed backend teams, alongside coordinating with frontend teams and other stakeholders. My main work specifically focusses on complex architectural decisions regarding company-wide services scalability, security and reliability.\newline\newline
I seek to leverage my knowledge and experience to help build customer-centric features in the product area, leading teams and helping in technical architectural designs.
